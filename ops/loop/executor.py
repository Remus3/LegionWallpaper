"""Pluggable EXECUTOR channel for the headless loop (the thing that does the work).

Companion seam to the adjudicator (the read-only BRAIN). The loop needs exactly
one thing from an executor: hand it a directive, get back what happened. That
was hard-wired to the AutoHotkey GUI bridge - a machine-wide singleton keyed on
a window title, which is why two loops could never run at once.

This module is the seam: one contract, `run(cycle, body, src) -> DoneRecord`,
with the AHK bridge lifted verbatim as today's default. The SDK backend
(headless `claude -p`) lands in P2; see
docs/specs/2026-07-26-f1-sdk-executor-channel.md.

P1 is a REFACTOR ONLY. Every string the AHK path writes, every deadline, every
log line and every stop() reason is byte-preserved from loop_controller.py - the
acceptance test is that a hermetic 2-cycle dry run produces byte-identical
control/ artifacts before and after. Nothing here is new behavior.

The controller owns the artifacts both channels share (directive.md, cycle.txt,
budget.json, the metering); the executor owns only what is channel-specific -
for AHK that is the gemini.ready typing handshake and the claude.done sentinel.

"""One-shot + reusable maintenance: replace U+2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT
HORIZONTAL with ASCII hyphen-minus in operator-granted target files.

Ported 1:1 from Riot Commander tools/strip_u2500.py (repair/scan logic
unchanged; RC-specific background and target lists dropped - LW starts
with zero U+2500 anywhere).

Background (inherited from the RC operating system hygiene sweeps):
U+2500 (UTF-8 bytes e2 94 80) shows up when box-drawing horizontal rules
in docstring section headers get authored with the box-drawing glyph
instead of plain ASCII '-'. Upstream, bulk U+2500 in frozen files was
normalized via the --allow-frozen operator grant; LW keeps the same
mechanism ready for the day the glyph drifts in.

WHY THIS TOOL IS NARROW-SCOPE (explicit file list, not repo-wide walk):
U+2500 can appear intentionally in authored files (test fixtures,
docstrings, ASCII-art separators). Unlike smart quotes or em-dashes
(which are banned globally by the CLAUDE.md hard rule), U+2500 is NOT a
banned codepoint. Sweeping it repo-wide could corrupt intentional
ASCII-art. Therefore this tool takes an EXPLICIT comma-separated path
list via --allow-frozen (which doubles as "explicit allowlist"), and
refuses to walk the repo blindly.

REPLACEMENT:
    U+2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL  -> 0x2D '-' (ASCII hyphen-minus)
    UTF-8 bytes:  e2 94 80  -> 2d   (3 bytes -> 1 byte)

The visual width changes (the box-drawing glyph is roughly the width of
an em-dash; ASCII '-' is narrower), but the SEMANTIC intent of a
horizontal separator rule is preserved. Tree-drawing patterns like
'+------+' become '+------+' (unchanged) since they used ASCII to begin
with; ASCII-art like '----' (built from U+2500) becomes '----' which still
reads as a rule.

ATOMIC WRITE: tmp.write_bytes() + os.replace() (Windows-safe).

EXCLUSIONS: the tool refuses to operate on any file NOT listed in
--allow-frozen. There is no implicit walk. _HARD_SKIP_FROZEN is the
defense-in-depth set: any path in that frozenset is NEVER rewritten
regardless of the flag. Currently empty so all listed files are
operator-grantable; bump ONLY with explicit operator authorization for
a specific path that must never be touched even by accidental grant.

Usage:
  C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python314/python.exe tools/strip_u2500.py --allow-frozen path/a.py,path/b.py
                          # rewrite the named files in place (atomic),
                          # report per-file pre/post counts
  C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python314/python.exe tools/strip_u2500.py --allow-frozen path/a.py --dry-run
                          # dry-run: report counts, no writes

Exit codes:
    0  if any file was rewritten (or, in --dry-run, any file would have been)
    1  if --allow-frozen was empty OR no listed file contained U+2500

This script keeps itself 7-bit ASCII (codepoints constructed via \\xNN
byte literals; no literal U+2500 glyph in the source) so it does not
self-trip the drift guard.

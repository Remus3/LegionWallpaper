# weekly_hygiene_run.ps1 - unattended weekly /weekly-hygiene pass on Legion.
#
# Documented scheduled-task name: LW-WeeklyHygiene (Sunday 04:17, after any
# nightly maintenance tasks so the anomaly-triage step sees fresh scheduled-task
# results). NOTE: the task name is a documented convention only - this file does
# NOT register the task; register it deliberately when LW's weekly schedule is
# set up. Runs Claude Code headless against the repo: the /weekly-hygiene skill
# does its relocate-only doc trims + memory staleness scan + session-start
# anomaly triage, then appends a dated entry to WAKEUP_NOTES.md so the operator
# sees flagged items at next session start. Mirrors the repo's headless
# `claude -p` invocation pattern (RC lineage: tools/headless_run.ps1).
#
# Usage (manual):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\LegionWallpaper\tools\weekly_hygiene_run.ps1"

Run /weekly-hygiene. This is an UNATTENDED scheduled run - no operator is
watching the chat. After the pass, append a short dated "weekly-hygiene"
entry to WAKEUP_NOTES.md listing (a) what you relocated and committed and
(b) every judgment call you flagged (memory suspects, actionable anomalies),
so I see them at next session start. Commit + push the relocate-only doc
trims and the WAKEUP entry when local checks are green, then exit. Do NOT
make code changes and do NOT run /sync-all-md.

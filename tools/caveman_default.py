"""caveman_default.py - SessionStart hook: declare CAVEMAN ULTRA as the default
output dialect for every Legion Claude Code session (operator 2026-06-27).

Wired in .claude/settings.json SessionStart hooks. Ported 1:1 from Riot
Commander tools/caveman_default.py (same machine, same operator default).
stdout is injected as session context. Must be fast (timeout 5) and must
NEVER raise - a crashing hook would noise every session start. Pairs with
tools/caveman.md (the skill body).

DIALECT HISTORY: a 2026-06-27 experiment layered WENYAN-FULL (classical Chinese)
on top of caveman for extra token economy; the operator reverted it the same day
(too lossy / hard to skim) back to CAVEMAN ULTRA - terse plain-ASCII caveman, no
classical Chinese.

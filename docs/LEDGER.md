# Legion Wallpaper - Item Ledger

Append-only, newest-first per-item completion record. Kept OUT of `CLAUDE.md`
by design (CLAUDE.md has a hard per-turn auto-load size budget - never append
ledger entries there). Do not rewrite history - append each new item at the TOP
of the body below (newest-first, directly under the `---` rule), matching the
entry format documented here.

**Entry format** (one numbered block per completed item, numbering starts at 1
and only ever increases):

```
N. DONE **YYYY-MM-DD (short title; commit SHAs or "docs-only").** Body: what
   shipped, premise verification, how it was built (TDD RED-first evidence,
   worktree slices, verifier verdict), what was verified (suite counts, health
   checks), doc/roadmap syncs, and any FUTURE / do-not-redo notes.
```

Conventions carried from the format's origin: bold date+title lead; premise
VERIFIED/CORRECTED called out explicitly; verification evidence (test counts,
exit codes, health probes) stated, never implied; scope calls and rejected
alternatives logged so they are not re-litigated.

Pointers: open work -> `ROADMAP.md` + `BACKLOG.md`; recent sessions ->
`WAKEUP_NOTES.md`; pruned ledger items + archived wakeups ->
`docs/history_notes.md`; decisions -> `docs/adr/`.

_No items yet. The first completed item is appended directly under the `---`
rule above as item 1._
